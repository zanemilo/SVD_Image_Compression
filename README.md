# 📷 Real-Time Image Compression with SVD

A lightweight real-time image compression tool using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) with an interactive GUI built in Tkinter. This project demonstrates matrix factorization-based image compression, enabling users to visually adjust the compression level and observe results in real-time.
## ✨ Features

 ✅ Load and Display Images – Supports various image formats.<br> ✅ Adjustable Compression Ratio – Modify compression level with a simple slider.<br> ✅ Real-Time Updates – Observe compression effects dynamically.<br> ✅ Preserves Image Quality – Leverages SVD to achieve high-quality compression while reducing file size.<br> ✅ Lightweight & Easy to Use – Simple Python implementation with minimal dependencies.
## 🚀 How It Works

The algorithm applies Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to compress images by reducing the number of singular values used in reconstruction. The more singular values retained, the higher the quality and file size; fewer values lead to stronger compression and reduced size.
## 🎯 Why Use SVD for Image Compression?

    Mathematically Robust – Decomposes the image into essential features.
    Flexible Compression – Users can control how much detail is preserved.
    Good for Low-Storage Applications – Reduces image size efficiently while maintaining structural integrity.
